<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p align="justify">Brain tumor classification using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical task in the field of medical image analysis. Accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors is essential for early diagnosis and timely treatment planning. In recent years, deep learning techniques have shown remarkable success in various image classification tasks, motivating their application to brain tumor MRI analysis.

    This project aims to develop a deep learning-based approach for brain tumor classification using MRI images. The proposed model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically learn discriminative features from MRI scans.  </p>
